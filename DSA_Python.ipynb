We have already seen that Python provides a number of numeric classes for our use. There are times, however, that it would be most appropriate to be able to create data objects that “look like” fractions.\n",
        "\n",
        "A fraction such as 3/5 consists of two parts. The top value, known as the numerator, can be any integer. The bottom value, called the denominator, can be any integer greater than 0 (negative fractions have a negative numerator). Although it is possible to create a floating point approximation for any fraction, in this case we would like to represent the fraction as an exact value.\n",

        "The operations for the Fraction type will allow a Fraction data object to behave like any other numeric value. We need to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. We also want to be able to show fractions using the standard “slash” form, for example 3/5. In addition, all fraction methods should return results in their lowest terms so that no matter what computation is performed, we always end up with the most common form.\n",

        "The first method that all classes should provide is the constructor. The constructor defines the way in which data objects are created. To create a Fraction object, we will need to provide two pieces of data, the numerator and the denominator. In Python, the constructor method is always called __init__ (two underscores before and after init)\n",

It must always be the first formal parameter; however, it will never be given an actual parameter value upon invocation. As described earlier, fractions require two pieces of state data, the numerator and the denominator. The notation self.num in the constructor defines the fraction object to have an internal data object called num as part of its state. Likewise, self.den creates the denominator. The values of the two formal parameters are initially assigned to the state, allowing the new fraction object to know its starting value.\n",

The only choice myf has is to show the actual reference that is stored in the variable (the address itself). This is not what we want.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways we can solve this problem. One is to define a method called show that will allow the Fraction object to print itself as a string. We can implement this method as shown in Listing 3. If we create a Fraction object as before, we can ask it to show itself, in other words, print itself in the proper format. Unfortunately, this does not work in general. In order to make printing work properly, we need to tell the Fraction class how to convert itself into a string.
